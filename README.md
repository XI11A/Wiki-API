#### Wiki API written in Python using Flask  

 ---
###### **NOTE:** You don't need to have Wikipedia link of the article in order to fetch the article details, you can directly search wiki by the query. 
 ---

### **Features**:
##### Currently the API can get the following details for a specific query in JSON format:
- **Query Name**
- **Query Summary**
- **Wiki URL**


```json
{
"query":"google",
"summary":"Google, LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.",
"title":"Google",
"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"
}
```

### **Installation**:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/XI11A/wiki-api
```
Enter the directory and install all the requirements using

#### You can fork the repo and deploy on VPS or deploy it on Heroku :)  

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/XI11A/wiki-api/tree/master)

**Note:** Heroku gives US/Europe servers which won't be able to fetch all Query flawlessly. Use any Indian VPS for accurate results.
